This language translator is a Natural Language Processing model.
It takes user voice as input then prints the text and translates it in some other language, prints the translated text and reads it aloud.
Currently, it supports six languages---
1. Hindi
2. English
3. German
4. Chinese
5. Korean
6. Japanese
More languages can be added in future according to the requirements.

The libraries/modules used in this model are---
1. speech_recognition -> Speech recognition, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition, or speech-to-text, is a capability which enables a program to process human speech into a written format.
2. pyttsx3 -> pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, it works offline and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.
3. voices -> this module is used to import system voices into the model.
4. googletrans -> Googletrans is a free and unlimited python library that implemented Google Translate API. This uses the Google Translate Ajax API to make calls to such methods as detect and translate.
